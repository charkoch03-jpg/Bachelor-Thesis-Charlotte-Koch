# Exploratory Analyses â€” Timecourse Analysis

This folder contains scripts for timecourse analyses of pupil size in the Free Viewing and Cue Task experiments. Both extract pupil size at multiple timepoints, add trial metadata, and run linear mixed models (LMMs) for different points in time.

## Files

### `lmmTimecourse_freeViewing.py`
- Extracts and builds dataframe with pupil size at ~100 ms intervals for each trial, participantID, current valence and previous valence.
- Fits LMMs: `pupilSize_i ~ valence * previous_valence + (1|participant)` per timepoint.
- Plots p-values of `valence` and `previous_valence` over time relative to picture onset.

### `lmmTimecourse_cueTask.py`
- Extracts and builds dataframe with pupil size at ~100 ms intervals for each trial, participantID, current valence, previous valence and task condition.
- Fits LMMs: `pupil_tp ~ valence + previous_valence + condition + (1|participant)` per timepoint.
- Plots p-values of fixed effects over time.
